**Alphabet Game**

This small program prints every letter of the alphabet once and allows the user to enter a word once in the program. 
Then it prints the results of the round.

Further updates will include:
~ A timer that will automatically iterate the next command (which is to print the next word) within the duration of time.
~ More than one round.
~ Results that seperate words that are incorrectly spelled or are made up, and display the results clearly.
